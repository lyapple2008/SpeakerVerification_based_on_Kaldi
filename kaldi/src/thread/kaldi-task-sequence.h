/**
   In kaldi-thread.h, the class MultiThreader, and the function
   RunMultiThreaded, provided a mechanism to run a specified number of jobs
   simultaneously, in parellel, and wait for them all to finish.  This file
   addresses a different problem, typically encountered in Kaldi command-line
   programs that process a sequence of items.  The problem is where
   items to be processed are coming in, all of different sizes (e.g. utterances
   with different numbers of frames) and we would like them to be run in
   parallel somehow, using multiple threads; but they must still make good use
   of the number of threads available; and they must be output in the same order
   as they came in.

   Here, we will still accept objects of some class C with an operator () that
   takes no arguments.  C may also have a constructor and a destructor that do
   something (typically the constructor just sets variables, and the destructor
   does some kind of output).  We have a templated class TaskSequencer<C> which
   is responsible for running the jobs in parallel.  It has a function Run()
   that will accept a new object of class C; this will block until a thread is
   free, at which time it will spawn a thread that starts running the operator
   () of the class.  When classes are finished running, the objects will be
   deleted.  Class TaskSequencer guarantees that the destructors will be called
   sequentially (not in parallel) and in the same order the objects were given
   to the Run() function, so that it is safe for the destructor to have side
   effects such as outputting data.

   Note: the destructor of TaskSequencer will wait for any remaining jobs that
   are still running and will call the destructors.
